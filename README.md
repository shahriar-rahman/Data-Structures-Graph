# Data-Structures-Graph
This is a fundamental concept of data structures graph ad its representation.


## Abstract
The predominant idea is to establish a concept of the behavior of graphs in the data structure. A non-linear graph is constructed where the point of origin starts from a given point A which slowly transitions to a set of vertices of the graph using connecting edges until the final node is reached. As a result, a network is created to pinpoint the quintessential elements of structured data that imitate any real-world networks such as circuits, pings, and, even Facebook.
